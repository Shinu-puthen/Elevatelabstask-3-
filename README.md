# Task-3 SQL Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains SQL queries and analysis performed on sales and market data to extract insights. The focus was on joining tables, grouping by market zones, and using aggregate functions to summarize sales.

## What Was Done
- Joined `transactions` and `markets` tables via `market_code` to combine transaction data with market information.
- Grouped sales data by `zone` to analyze performance region-wise.
- Applied aggregate functions such as `COUNT()` and `SUM()` for transaction counts and total sales.
- Demonstrated SQL concepts including JOINs, GROUP BY clauses, aggregate functions, subqueries, and handling NULL values.
- Suggested query optimization techniques like indexing join keys and using views.

## Tools Used
- SQL with MySQL

## Outcome
Gained practical experience in SQL querying and analysis, suitable for data analyst roles working on structured data.

## Repository Contents
- SQL query files with execution outputs
- This README.md explaining the approach and functions used
